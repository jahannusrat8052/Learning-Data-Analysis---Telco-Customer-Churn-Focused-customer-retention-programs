## üìù Abstract

Customer churn remains a significant issue in the telecommunications industry, where competition is high and retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This study explores the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** through comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and predictive modeling. Using logistic regression and random forest classifiers, we identify the most important drivers of churn, evaluate model performance, and provide insights for practical customer retention strategies. Results show that **contract type, tenure, payment method, and monthly charges** are the strongest indicators of churn.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscription to a service. For telecom companies, this directly impacts revenue and growth. Proactively predicting churn allows companies to design retention programs, optimize service offerings, and improve customer satisfaction.

This project investigates the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** with the following goals:

1. Conduct data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends related to churn.
3. Apply machine learning models to predict churn and evaluate their performance.
4. Identify actionable insights to help reduce churn rates in real-world applications.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Telco Customer Churn dataset (IBM sample dataset).
- **Size**: 7043 records, 21 columns.
- **Features**:
  - **Categorical**: Gender, Contract, Internet Service, Payment Method, etc.
  - **Numerical**: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges.
- **Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No).

### Data Distribution

- **Churned customers**: 26.5%  
- **Retained customers**: 73.5%  

This imbalance indicates a non-trivial churn rate that requires predictive modeling.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Literature Context

Research in customer churn prediction shows that **contract terms, billing methods, and service quality** are among the strongest churn drivers. Classical machine learning methods such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forests** are widely used, often providing a balance between interpretability and predictive accuracy. Our study builds upon these foundations by combining detailed exploratory analysis with baseline models before recommending next steps such as advanced ensemble methods.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

- **Missing values** removed.
- **Categorical variables** converted using one-hot encoding.
- Dataset split into **80% training** and **20% testing**.

### 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Key Findings:

- **Contracts**: Customers with **month-to-month contracts** exhibit the highest churn rates.
- **Tenure**: Shorter-tenure customers churn more frequently.
- **Charges**: High monthly charges correlate with higher churn, while higher total charges correlate with retention.
- **Payment Methods**: Customers using **electronic checks** are more likely to churn compared to those using automatic payments.

### 4.3 Modeling Approaches

Two baseline models were applied:

1. **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì chosen for its interpretability and baseline predictive power.
2. **Random Forest Classifier** ‚Äì chosen for its ability to capture feature interactions and non-linearities.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Results

### 5.1 Logistic Regression

- **Accuracy**: 82%  
- **Precision/Recall**: Higher recall for non-churn customers, moderate recall for churners.

### 5.2 Random Forest

- **Accuracy**: 80%  
- Performed slightly lower than logistic regression, but confirmed the same key churn drivers.

### 5.3 Important Features Identified

- **Tenure** (longer tenure ‚Üí less churn).  
- **Contract type** (month-to-month ‚Üí more churn).  
- **Payment method** (electronic check ‚Üí more churn).  
- **Monthly charges** (higher charges ‚Üí more churn).

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Discussion

The analysis highlights several **business-relevant implications**:

- **Short tenure** is a critical churn signal. Retention programs should target customers within their first year of service.
- **Month-to-month contracts** carry higher churn risk. Incentivizing longer-term contracts could reduce churn.
- **High monthly charges** indicate dissatisfaction or perceived low value. Introducing tiered pricing or discounts could mitigate this.
- **Electronic check users** may churn due to inconvenience. Encouraging automatic payment adoption could lower churn rates.

From a modeling perspective:

- Logistic Regression provided a simple, interpretable baseline with strong accuracy.
- Random Forest confirmed the same features as important, though with slightly lower performance.
- Future work could involve testing **XGBoost or Gradient Boosting**, as well as handling class imbalance with **SMOTE or weighted models**.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

This study demonstrates the value of **data-driven churn prediction**.

- **EDA revealed actionable customer behavior patterns**, such as the impact of contracts, payment methods, and tenure.  
- **Predictive models achieved ~82% accuracy**, providing reliable churn detection.  
- **Business strategies informed by this analysis** include targeting new customers for retention, promoting long-term contracts, and optimizing payment methods.  

Ultimately, combining **exploratory insights** with **predictive modeling** enables telecom companies to make informed, proactive decisions to minimize customer churn.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Future Work

- Apply advanced ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM).  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.  
- Develop a real-time churn prediction dashboard for business teams.  
- Explore **customer segmentation** to personalize retention strategies.
